Anyone with an internet connection and a device to use it\r\n          can log on.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p> The Darknet/Dark Web/Deep Web as a whole is approximately 17 times larger in size than the surface web<sup>7</sup>.\r\n        Whereas the Surface Web has all of it’s contents stored somewhere within a consistent unchanging HTML file (unless it’s being manually updated\r\n        by the website host) the Deep Web is constantly changing.  These hidden websites that exist here are hosted by individuals instead of corporations\r\n        or small businesses.  As a result you may only have access to a website within a certain window of the day, you may have clicked the same link last\r\n        week but now it goes to something entirely different or a “dead” link with a 404 host not found error being shown.  Not only this but due to the navigation\r\n        encryption system that the Deep/Dark web uses, makes many load times for various sites very slow.  There’s a consistent changing that makes a newcomer's\r\n        introduction to the Deep Web confusing and strange in comparison to the static use of the Surface Web.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <sup class=\"center\">Source 6</sup>\r\n          <img src=\"imagestuff.png\" alt=\"figure1\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" class=\"center\" ></img>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>The Deep Web is a huge collection of sites being hosted independently for differing reasons.\r\n        Some are perfectly fine by moral standards and others are completely illegal and are explicitly stated to be so.  \r\n        According to researchers Victoria Wang, Jeyong Jung, and Mihnea Mirea from the Security Journal<sup>4</sup>:  \r\n        These activities could be grouped into three main categories: (i) activism, journalism, and whistle-blowing; \r\n        (ii) criminal activities in virtual markets; and (iii) cyber security threats including botnets, malware, and ransomware.”\r\n        The Deep Web had been originally used for social and political purposes where individuals could share their societal and political beliefs without \r\n        fear of ridicule or prosecution (depending on the environment/government).  By using a truly anonymous platform whistle blowing and freedom of speech\r\n        reaches new heights however unregulated it may be. “During the Egyptian riots, for example, journalists and activists from around the world bypassed \r\n        government censorship through Tor. They thus successfully informed the world about what was happening in Egypt (Stacey 2017).”<sup>4</sup>  This sharing and leaking\r\n        of classified government secrets or of wrongdoings by people within authoritative positions puts any whistleblower in a dangerous often life threatening\r\n        situation.  Famous whistleblowers like Edward Snowden come to mind here.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The most famous market on the deep web was designed to specialize in the trade of illegal drugs, identities, credit card information, weapons, and contract killings.\r\n        It was known as the Silk Road.  It is stated that it was promoting political movements against law agencies and destabilizing governments\r\n        The Silk Road dominated the Deep Web as a central focus and icon for what the Deep Web was back in 2011.\r\n        Since then the market side of the Deep Web has dramatically changed and turned into more recognizable business models.\r\n        </p>\r\n        \r\n        <p>The Silk Road was taken down by police (as in turned offline, not destroyed) and later different iterations of it have come and gone, bringing forth things such as “Black Market Reloaded” and “Sheep Marketplace” and other quips and naming conventions.\r\n        There has even grown to be an EBay style of user interaction between buyer and seller of different goods, designed to protect anonymity and settle disputes.\r\n        The Deep Web is not the safest place, security wise.  There exist many hacking programs designed to directly or indirectly attack corporations or random individuals that are sold in various marketplaces.  Creators of malware share various techniques and methods to gain information and break down the barriers of security between devices. \r\n         Keyloggers and various consistent connection malware are common market items that despite being simple in concept, have a great deal of tact and design put into them creating stronger stealthier malware tools.  With the use of anonymous cryptocurrency these tools have great market potential.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p></p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default History;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Symbolism extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h1 class=\"center\">What does it mean?\r\n        </h1>\r\n        <img src=\"darknetimg.jpg\" alt=\"figure1\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" class=\"center\" ></img>\r\n\r\n        <sup class=\"center\">Source 12</sup>\r\n        <p>The Dark web represents (within the western world) the fear of a power structure that exists beyond the realm of authority.\r\n        From here on out I will be referring to the modern, social context for the Dark Web/ Deep Net. I will refer to the Dark Web and Deep net interchangably, because in the publics eye they are\r\n        not entirely different.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>There is a common visualization of what the dark net is, it’s the “alleyway of the internet”.  It’s this black market, a hidden marketplace for murder, sex, human trafficking, drugs, and much much more.  Not only is it a place hidden from law enforcement it is a place that is morally defunct. “Read nearly any article about the dark web, and you'll get the sense that its name connotes not just its secrecy but also the low-down dirty content of its shadowy realms. You’ll be told that it is home to several nefarious things: stolen data, terrorist sites, and child porn” - Joseph Cox, journalist for Wired news<sup>10</sup>.  Whether or not this is true these rumors come from somewhere and they mean something.  On various news outlets and websites there has been discussion that Al Qaeda had been using the dark web in order to communicate world wide, creating terrorist forums for extremists. </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          The internet has been around since the mid 1980s as a network of networks.\r\n          Why have people been deciding that the Dark Web is a lawless black market for anything and\r\n          everything?  The “dark” name?  The stories of the Silk Road?\r\n          Regardless, we can see it’s reputation as being filled with lawless market dealings.\r\n          The boogeyman of the internet.  Something out there that is morally defunct from the rest of society.\r\n          It must be run by shady criminals right?\r\n           </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          We consider it as being run by something akin to a mafia,\r\n          an organized crime indication.  There is this fear of what is being sold,\r\n          the illicit.  The crime.  It’s the idea that something is being run from underneath our\r\n          incorruptible internet connection, something we can tap into with the breeze of our fingers.\r\n          A dangerous element.  We can look at it as a sort of inversion of society almost.  It’s been compared\r\n          to the wild west after all, why not discuss it and view it as such?  Little to no moderation, many shady dealings,\r\n          and danger around every click of a hyperlink.  Why wouldn’t we fear it?\r\n           </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>I would view it almost as a conspiracy (once again ignore the binary truth value we assign to things).  The idea that there exists this massive shadow network\r\n        of individuals in a seedy market that is accessible from our own internet connection is a daunting one to say the least.  To think that there are recorded instances\r\n        of people running massive drug trades worldwide via this marketplace.  But, the thing that the dark net/deep web assigns to itself more than anything is anonymity.\r\n        Put on the (IP address) mask and walk into a new world.  A world where you can’t see anyone's real name or face, race, or ethnicity.\r\n        A place where you can only see what is being sold.  You could buy a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher, you could order a hitman, child pornography, perhaps receive\r\n        a mail order bride.  Anyone could do it in fact.  It’s as simple as having an internet connection and a bank account.  Mind you, you can also just turn your money into\r\n        cryptocurrency, an also untraceable method of conducting business across any platform.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Is it the fear of anonymity in\r\n        the otherwise constantly identifiable world?\r\n        Whereas you may be anonymous at your own whim on many sites, now everyone has it?\r\n        The fear of unidentifiable power that anyone could have.\r\n        Your neighbor, your best friend, your mother, brother, any of them really.\r\n        The president could have it, the business owner down the street could order whatever they wanted.\r\n        The ease of access (and simultaneously the lack of knowledge on the ease of access) is a level of\r\n        terrifying knowledge that many people think just having is incriminating enough.  There exists a concept about the Darkweb in\r\n        part a combination of powerful anonymity and ease of access that people mystify it as such.  However one must consider the idea that\r\n        there is a large population of the American public that doesn’t actually KNOW* how to access it.  They don’t know you can download the\r\n        TOR (The Onion Router) to access any website with a level of privacy that the common individual just assumes they may already have.  Using\r\n        TOR you can access anything by using various encryptions in order to protect your privacy, thus allowing any basic browsing data on an individual\r\n        to be hidden from various purchasers/gatherers of information.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Despite the fact that this anonymity has been used for much good such as whistleblowing on corruption within government agencies and corporations,\r\n        there is this belief that such anonymity means there are darker secrets to hide. This belief that if you have nothing to hide, then why would you ever\r\n        bother hiding information at all?  “The innocent have nothing to hide” is a saying that many Americans believe.\r\n          </p>\r\n        <p>It’s possible to read a distrust of individuals with more than capable computer/techno literacy within the “modern computer” realm of expertise. Your av\r\n        erage 40-50 year old wouldn’t know how to access such a thing, in fact the idea of not using the most common web browsers might create great discomfort in\r\n        such a user.  The individuals who grew up with more and more technology being integrated into everyday living at a younger age are shown to have a firmer\r\n        grasp on the fundamentals of internet safety and browsing.  We have to take into account the level of mystery that the less technologically inclined or more\r\n        technologically disconnected feel about such things.\r\n            </p>\r\n        <h2 class=\"center\">Wrap Up</h2>\r\n        <p>If we analyze this stigma around the DarkWeb\r\n        as some form of a “Hidden Transcript”, a way of venting discourse or frustration around individuals with power then we can begin to see an idea here.\r\n              This narrative of </p>\r\n        <li>A shadowy marketplace that anyone can access</li>\r\n        <li>Pure Anonymity in an otherwise non-anonymous world</li>\r\n        <li>Societal Taboos are for sale here</li>\r\n        <li>It's \"public\" to anyone who is comfortable with computers yet \"secret\" to anyone who is not</li>\r\n\r\n        <p>This shows us a few things and allows us to draw many different possible interpretations, I'll discuss the one I think is most pliable within my experiences and \r\n          research although more definitely exist.</p>\r\n        <p>I can narrow it down to what I think is a fear of the “technologically educated” in combination with the fact \r\n          that technology is becoming more and more involved into everyday lives.  Money transactions are online, sharing information\r\n        online, marketing is online, there’s more and more that’s going to be eternally locked into this digital world.  To coin\r\n        it in a word, a sort of aristo-techno-phobia.  Not the fear of technology itself, which is technophobia but instead the fear\r\n        of the more well equipped technologically.  Which can be tied even deeper to some form of fear of inferiority, of powerlessness in the\r\n        new dimension of the first world countries.\r\n              </p>This feeling of powerlessness isn't random                \r\n                In the cultural world there is a level of uncertainty that is scary.  There is a comfort within technology that others do not have.\r\n                It's important to note I'm not talking about individuals who use facebook all day and don't know how to use \r\n                \"the google\" (although they could be included in this discussion) \r\n                I'm discussing a worker removed from a more complicated framework, someone who works in society without the guise of a formal technological education.\r\n                I would argue the vast majority of the U.S. population doesn't have this style of education creating a gap between those who do have this knowledge and those who do not.\r\n                Those who do have this knowledge might be represented as smarter and more dangerous to the success of others without this knowledge.   \r\n              <p>  \r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>To be made uneducated about the world in the wake of a revolution similar to the industrial revolution puts this group of people in a \r\n          less powerful state.  This advancement into a technological revolution has created a group of people who can use the tools given to them but not\r\n        understand the context for the tools themselves (tools meaning many facets of social media, e-banking,  and other common applications within the\r\n        E-world we live in).  It creates a sense of fear, a sense of distrust.  This distrust is being expressed through the rumors and hidden transcript within\r\n        the idea of the Dark Web.\r\n        It can be looked at as a fear of being left behind culturally while being taken advantage of by the new generation (technological and literal generation). \r\n         Afterall, being left behind by your own culture's advances can symbolistically be akin to the obsolescence of a whole generation \r\n         of people, and to the people. </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Symbolism;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Sources extends Component {\r\n    //H2 is our bigger text block, title style\r\n            //More than likely will be the \"title\" of any such source used\r\n\r\n    // p will be our body text to anything that goes on.\r\n            //Informationon how to find the source, and other information regarding how to access such things will be listed here.\r\n\r\n        \r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h1 class=\"center\">Sources</h1>\r\n        <h2>History of the internet</h2>\r\n       \r\n        <br></br>\r\n        <li><sup>1</sup>https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/</li>\r\n        <li><sup>2</sup>https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/internet-speech</li>\r\n        <li><sup>3</sup>https://time.com/5770755/threat-free-speech-online/</li>\r\n\r\n        <br></br>\r\n        <h2>Scholarly Articles</h2>\r\n        <li><sup>4</sup>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41284-018-0150-5</li>\r\n        <li><sup>5</sup>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444814554900</li>\r\n        <li><sup>6</sup>https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44101.pdf        </li>\r\n        <li><sup>7</sup>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239440978_White_Paper_The_Deep_Web_Surfacing_Hidden_Value</li>\r\n        <li><sup>8</sup>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15295036.2016.1243249?src=recsys&journalCode=rcsm20</li>\r\n        <li><sup>9</sup>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1228990</li>\r\n        \r\n        <br></br>\r\n        <h2>Other Sources</h2>\r\n        <li><sup>9</sup>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/illuminating-the-dark-web/</li>\r\n        <li><sup>10</sup>https://www.wired.com/2015/06/dark-web-know-myth/</li>\r\n        <li><sup>11</sup>http://lab.cccb.org/en/the-dark-web-between-the-myth-and-the-promise-of-anonymity/</li>\r\n        <li><sup>12</sup>https://www.newscientist.com/article/2126472-trackers-could-unmask-dark-web-users-who-think-theyre-anonymous/</li>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default Sources;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport {\r\n    Route,\r\n    NavLink,\r\n    HashRouter\r\n  } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n  import Home from \"./Home\";\r\n  import History from \"./History\";\r\n  import Symbolism from \"./Symbolism\";\r\n  import Sources from \"./Sources\";\r\n\r\n  import \"./index.css\";\r\n//Home\r\n  //About me, about the discussion of what this is, BlackMarket/DeepWeb a little.
