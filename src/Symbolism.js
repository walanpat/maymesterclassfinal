        <p>The Dark web represents (within the western world) the fear of a power structure that exists beyond the realm of authority.
        From here on out I will be referring to the modern, social context for the Dark Web/ Deep Net. I will refer to the Dark Web and Deep net interchangably, because in the publics eye they are
        not entirely different.
        </p>

        <p>There is a common visualization of what the dark net is, it’s the “alleyway of the internet”.  It’s this black market, a hidden marketplace for murder, sex, human trafficking, drugs, and much much more.  Not only is it a place hidden from law enforcement it is a place that is morally defunct. “Read nearly any article about the dark web, and you'll get the sense that its name connotes not just its secrecy but also the low-down dirty content of its shadowy realms. You’ll be told that it is home to several nefarious things: stolen data, terrorist sites, and child porn” - Joseph Cox, journalist for Wired news<sup>10</sup>.  Whether or not this is true these rumors come from somewhere and they mean something.  On various news outlets and websites there has been discussion that Al Qaeda had been using the dark web in order to communicate world wide, creating terrorist forums for extremists. </p>

        <p>
          The internet has been around since the mid 1980s as a network of networks.
          Why have people been deciding that the Dark Web is a lawless black market for anything and
          everything?  The “dark” name?  The stories of the Silk Road?
          Regardless, we can see it’s reputation as being filled with lawless market dealings.
          The boogeyman of the internet.  Something out there that is morally defunct from the rest of society.
          It must be run by shady criminals right?
           </p>

        <p>
          We consider it as being run by something akin to a mafia,
          an organized crime indication.  There is this fear of what is being sold,
          the illicit.  The crime.  It’s the idea that something is being run from underneath our
          incorruptible internet connection, something we can tap into with the breeze of our fingers.
          A dangerous element.  We can look at it as a sort of inversion of society almost.  It’s been compared
          to the wild west after all, why not discuss it and view it as such?  Little to no moderation, many shady dealings,
          and danger around every click of a hyperlink.  Why wouldn’t we fear it?
           </p>

        <p>I would view it almost as a conspiracy (once again ignore the binary truth value we assign to things).  The idea that there exists this massive shadow network
        of individuals in a seedy market that is accessible from our own internet connection is a daunting one to say the least.  To think that there are recorded instances
        of people running massive drug trades worldwide via this marketplace.  But, the thing that the dark net/deep web assigns to itself more than anything is anonymity.
        Put on the (IP address) mask and walk into a new world.  A world where you can’t see anyone's real name or face, race, or ethnicity.
        A place where you can only see what is being sold.  You could buy a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher, you could order a hitman, child pornography, perhaps receive
        a mail order bride.  Anyone could do it in fact.  It’s as simple as having an internet connection and a bank account.  Mind you, you can also just turn your money into
        cryptocurrency, an also untraceable method of conducting business across any platform.
              </p>

        <p>Is it the fear of anonymity in
        the otherwise constantly identifiable world?
        Whereas you may be anonymous at your own whim on many sites, now everyone has it?
        The fear of unidentifiable power that anyone could have.
        Your neighbor, your best friend, your mother, brother, any of them really.
        The president could have it, the business owner down the street could order whatever they wanted.
        The ease of access (and simultaneously the lack of knowledge on the ease of access) is a level of
        terrifying knowledge that many people think just having is incriminating enough.  There exists a concept about the Darkweb in
        part a combination of powerful anonymity and ease of access that people mystify it as such.  However one must consider the idea that
        there is a large population of the American public that doesn’t actually KNOW* how to access it.  They don’t know you can download the
        TOR (The Onion Router) to access any website with a level of privacy that the common individual just assumes they may already have.  Using
        TOR you can access anything by using various encryptions in order to protect your privacy, thus allowing any basic browsing data on an individual
        to be hidden from various purchasers/gatherers of information.
          </p>

        <p>Despite the fact that this anonymity has been used for much good such as whistleblowing on corruption within government agencies and corporations,
        there is this belief that such anonymity means there are darker secrets to hide. This belief that if you have nothing to hide, then why would you ever
        bother hiding information at all?  “The innocent have nothing to hide” is a saying that many Americans believe.
          </p>
        <p>It’s possible to read a distrust of individuals with more than capable computer/techno literacy within the “modern computer” realm of expertise. Your av
        erage 40-50 year old wouldn’t know how to access such a thing, in fact the idea of not using the most common web browsers might create great discomfort in
        such a user.  The individuals who grew up with more and more technology being integrated into everyday living at a younger age are shown to have a firmer
        grasp on the fundamentals of internet safety and browsing.  We have to take into account the level of mystery that the less technologically inclined or more
        technologically disconnected feel about such things.
            </p>
        <h2 class="center">Wrap Up</h2>
        <p>If we analyze this stigma around the DarkWeb
        as some form of a “Hidden Transcript”, a way of venting discourse or frustration around individuals with power then we can begin to see an idea here.
              This narrative of </p>
        <li>A shadowy marketplace that anyone can access</li>
        <li>Pure Anonymity in an otherwise non-anonymous world</li>
        <li>Societal Taboos are for sale here</li>
        <li>It's "public" to anyone who is comfortable with computers yet "secret" to anyone who is not</li>

        <p>This shows us a few things and allows us to draw many different possible interpretations, I'll discuss the one I think is most pliable within my experiences and 
          research although more definitely exist.</p>
        <p>I can narrow it down to what I think is a fear of the “technologically educated” in combination with the fact 
          that technology is becoming more and more involved into everyday lives.  Money transactions are online, sharing information
        online, marketing is online, there’s more and more that’s going to be eternally locked into this digital world.  To coin
        it in a word, a sort of aristo-techno-phobia.  Not the fear of technology itself, which is technophobia but instead the fear
        of the more well equipped technologically.  Which can be tied even deeper to some form of fear of inferiority, of powerlessness in the
        new dimension of the first world countries.
              </p>This feeling of powerlessness isn't random                
                In the cultural world there is a level of uncertainty that is scary.  There is a comfort within technology that others do not have.
                It's important to note I'm not talking about individuals who use facebook all day and don't know how to use 
                "the google" (although they could be included in this discussion) 
                I'm discussing a worker removed from a more complicated framework, someone who works in society without the guise of a formal technological education.
                I would argue the vast majority of the U.S. population doesn't have this style of education creating a gap between those who do have this knowledge and those who do not.
                Those who do have this knowledge might be represented as smarter and more dangerous to the success of others without this knowledge.   
              <p>  
              </p>


        <p>To be made uneducated about the world in the wake of a revolution similar to the industrial revolution puts this group of people in a 
          less powerful state.  This advancement into a technological revolution has created a group of people who can use the tools given to them but not
        understand the context for the tools themselves (tools meaning many facets of social media, e-banking,  and other common applications within the
        E-world we live in).  It creates a sense of fear, a sense of distrust.  This distrust is being expressed through the rumors and hidden transcript within
        the idea of the Dark Web.
        It can be looked at as a fear of being left behind culturally while being taken advantage of by the new generation (technological and literal generation). 
         Afterall, being left behind by your own culture's advances can symbolistically be akin to the obsolescence of a whole generation 
         of people, and to the people. </p>
