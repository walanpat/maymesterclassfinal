        <h2>The Rite of Ordination</h2>

        <p>
          {' '}
          The Rite of Ordination is what defines an individual as a priest in
          the eyes of the Catholic Church. The person receiving it must have
          already worked as a deacon and it must be performed by ministers of
          the Holy Orders in order to be considered valid. This ritual is done
          during a Holy Mass. The candidates are called forward and presented to
          the assembly (laity and ministers alike) where they are asked
          questions and make promises. Each then promises to faithfully perform
          the duties of the priesthood and to obey and respect his ordinary
          (superior clergyman).
        </p>
        <p>
          Below I will list the process for the entire ordination ceremony. It
          has multiple stages and each of these stages has unique and important
          actions to be carried out for the ordination ceremony to be valid.
        </p>
        <h3>Introductory Rites</h3>
        <p>
          When all is prepared there shall be a procession that moves through
          the church to the alway in the exact same way as usual Mass is
          performed. There is a Deacon who shall be carrying the Book of Gospels
          and is followed by the other deacons (if there are any). From here
          they are followed by the candidates of ordination, then the
          con-celebrating priests, and finally the Bishop. The Bishop shall have
          immediately behind him two deacons who shall assist him.{' '}
          <sup> Source 9</sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Liturgy of the Word</h3>
        <p>
          This takes place in its usual form. Liturgy of the Word does not
          change from its normal occurrance during mass.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h1>Liturgy of Ordination</h1>
        <p>
          Everything listed from here on out is a part of the Liturgy of
          Ordination.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>Election</h2>
        <p>
          The Calling, Presentation of the candidates, and Election by the
          Bishop and Assent of the people all fall under the Rites of Election.
        </p>
        <h3>Calling of Candidates</h3>
        <p>
          When the preparations have been made then each candidate is called
          forward by the Deacon of the Call.
        </p>
        <h3>Presentation of Candidates</h3>
        <p>
          The candidates are formally presented to the bishop by the Diocesan
          Director of the Office of Vocations
        </p>
        <h3>Election by the Bishop and Assent of the People</h3>
        <p>
          {' '}
          Here the deacon will call the candidates forward. Their names are
          called by the deacon. Each one shall answer "Present".
          <br /> Then each Candidate shall go to the Bishop, from each they
          shall show him a sign of reverence. <br />
          Then the Bishop shall state: <br />
          "Most Reverend Father, Holy mother Church asks you to ordain these,
          our brothers, to the responsibility of the priesthood, Do you know
          them to be worthy?"
          <br />
          The priest designated by the Bishop shall answer:
          <br /> "After inquiry among the Christian people and upon the
          recommendation of those responsible, I testify that they have been
          found worthy"
          <br />
          The Bishop will respond with:
          <br /> "Relying on the help of the Lord God and our Savior Jesus
          Christ, we choose these, our brothers, for the Order of the
          Priesthood."
          <br />
          The laity and ordained alike then all respond <br />
          "Thanks be to god". <br />
          This affirms the Election by the Bishop and the Assent of the People.
          <sup>Source 9</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Homily</h2>
        <p>
          There will then be an instructional homily discussing the practice of
          the priesthood according to the teachings of the Second Vatican
          Council. This homily will speak on how Christ as the teacher, priest,
          and shepherd continues through the ministerial priesthood. It also
          states that priests are to be colleagues of the bishop, joining with
          him in the task of exercising the priesthood office in service to the
          Citizens of God. The office reminds those too soon to be ordained that
          they are to model their lives on Jesus Christ, "The Good Shepherd, who
          came not to be served but to serve, and to seek out and save what was
          lost".
        </p>
        <h3>Promises of the Elect</h3>
        <p>
          5 promises must be made to continue with the ordination ceremony
          <br /> <br />
          Promise to discharge the office of priesthood in the presbyterial rank
          as worthy fellow workers with the order of bishops
          <br /> <br />
          Promise to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely,
          preaching the gospel and teaching the Catholic faith
          <br /> <br />
          Promise to celebrate faithfully and reverently the mysteries of Christ
          handed down by the Church, especially the sacrifice of the Eucharist
          and the sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God and the
          Sanctification of the Christian People
          <br /> <br />
          Promise to implore God's mercy upon the people entrusted to their care
          by observing the Command to pray without ceasing.?
          <br /> <br />
          Promise to be united more closely every day to Christ the High Priest
          who offered himself for us to the Father as a pure sacrifice and to
          consecrate themselves to God for the Salvation of All
        </p>
        <h3>Promise of Obedience</h3>
        <p>
          Once all of these promises have been made, each candidate to be
          ordained goes to the bishop and makes a promise of obedience. When he
          does so he kneels before the bishop, placing his hands between the
          bishops. The bishop will then ask him "do you promise respect and
          obedience to me and my successors?" The candidate will then answer
          yes, otherwise he shall be refuted from the clergy.

        </div>

        <p>
          Every candidate that's made it this far will then prostrate onto the
          floor and the Litany of the Saints shall be sung. The Litany of the
          Saints is a prayer asking for the intercession of the saints in so
          that God may look down favorably upon those who are to be ordained.
          Then a prayer following the song occurs asking that the Holy Spirit
          may be poured upon them. During these prayers the faithful (laity) are
          to join in on the prayers for the candidates for ordination.
        </p>
        <h3>Invitation to Prayer</h3>
        <p>
          The congregation and minister pray for the soon to be ordained priests
          and that they receive good health and tidings.
        </p>
        <h3>Litany of the Saints</h3>
        <p>
          The Litany of the Saints is sung in the church. It's a very ancient
          prayer that is sung only on Easter Vigil and at Ordination ceremonies.{' '}

        <h3>Concluding Prayer</h3>
        <p>
          "Hear us, we Beseech you, Lord Our God, <br />
          and pour out on these servants of yours <br />
          the blessing of the Holy Spirit and the power of
          <br />
          priestly grace,
          <br />
          that those whom in the sight of your mercy we offer to
          <br />
          be consecrated,
          <br />
          may be surrounded by your rich and unfailing gifts.
          <br />
          Through Christ our Lord."
          <br />
          <br />
          All shall answer: Amen

        <h2>Laying on of Hands and Prayer of Ordination</h2>
        <p>
          The gift of the Holy Spirit is brought to those to be ordained by the
          laying on of hands and the final prayer of ordination. Here, at the
          ordination of a priest, the ordaining bishop shall lay his hands on
          each man to be ordained a priest. All of the priests who are present
          will then lay hands on each candidate just as the bishop did. This
          laying on of hands acts as a symbol that they are to be ordained into
          the presbyterial college of the Church they are being ordained at. All
          of this must be done in silence, that is because the clergy wishes to
          keep with an ancient tradition found within an old text known as
          Apostolic Tradition. Apostolic Tradition is believed by many to have
          been written by Hippolytus in 280 A.D. Here he states that the laying
          on of hands occurs in the priests ordination due to the fact that
          "they all have a common and similar spirit".

            The laying on of hands occurs here as the bishop touches each one of
            the candidates for priesthood. Image Source 2
          </sup>
        </div>
        <p>
          Each candidate shall go one by one to the bishop and kneel before him.
          Then the bishop shall lay his hands on the head of each in complete
          silence. This laying on of hands and the prayer of ordination which
          follows directly after shall constitute the essential elements of the
          sacrament of Holy Orders. Then all the priests shall lay their hands
          on each head of the candidates.
        </p>
        <h3>Prayer of Ordination</h3>
        <p>
          The bishop will then say the prayer of ordination alone. This directly
          alludes to Aaron and the seventy elders as called by Moses. Old
          testament figures that prefigure the presbyters who will work as
          coworkers of the bishop? .This prayer is directed directly to the
          Father who by the grace of the Holy Spirit provides for all forms of
          ministry within the Church of Christ. After the bishop speaks upon the
          various forms of ministry exercised within the church he will state
          that the priests are those who assisted the apostles in making Christ
          present in the Church today.
        </p>
        <h2>Explanatory Rites</h2>
        <p> The Rites that follow are explanatory Rites:</p>
        <h3>Investiture with Stole and Chasuble</h3>
        <p>
          The newly ordained priests stay standing, and are vested with the
          stole and chasuble as symbolic representation of their new power and
          office in the church.
        </p>
        <h3>Anointing of Hands</h3>
        <p>
          The newly ordained priests have their hands anointed with "sacred
          chrism". This symbolizes the power granted before them to perform the
          Eucharist, changing bread into the Body of Christ and wine into the
          Blood of Christ.
        </p>
        <h3>Presentation of Bread and Wine</h3>
        <p>
          The ordaining bishop shall then receive gifts of bread and wine from
          the laity celebrating mass. Once the chalice and paten have been
          prepared, it is presented to the bishop, who then presents it to the
          new priests as they kneel before him.{' '}
        </p>
        <h3>Kiss of Peace</h3>
        <p>
          The bishop leading the ordination ceremony gives a fraternal kiss that
          is also known as the sign of peace to each of the new priests. The
          attending priests also follow suit. This gesture specifically is a
          sign of welcome into the Priesthood of the Catholic Church, which they
          all share duty in as brothers.

          And so the newly ordained priests may engage in the Eucharist with the
          laity as an ordained priest for the first time. It's a time of
          celebration and great reverence, as the priests give their first
          Eucharist with their audience of Ordination.{' '}
