        <h2>The Rite of Ordination</h2>

        <p>
          {' '}
          The Rite of Ordination is what defines an individual as a priest in the eyes of the Catholic Church. The
          person receiving it must have already working as a deacon and, it must be
          performed by ministers of the Holy Orders in order to be considered
          valid. This ritual is done during a Holy Mass. The candidates are
          called forwared and presented to the assembly (laity and ministers
          alike) where they are asked question`s and make promises. Each then
          promises to faithfully perform the duties of the priesthood and to
          obey and respect his ordinary (superior clergyman).
        </p>
        <p>
          Below I will list the process for the entire ordination ceremony. It
          has multiple stages and each of these stages has unique and important
          actions to be carried out for the ordination ceremony to be valid.
        </p>
        <h3>Introductory Rites</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Liturgy of the Word</h3>
        <p>
          This takes place in its usual form. Liturgy of the Word does not
          change from its normal occurance during mass.
        </p>
        <h3>Liturgy of Ordination</h3>
        <h2>Election</h2>
        <p>The Calling, Presentation of the cadnidates, and Election by the Bishop and Assent of the people all fall under the Rites of Election.</p>
        <h3>Calling of Candidates</h3>
        <p>When the preparations have been made then each candidate is called forward by the Deacon of the Call.</p>
        <h3>Presentation of Candidates</h3>
        <p>The candidates are formally presented to the bishop by the Diocesan Director of the Office of Vocations</p>
        <h3>Election by the Bishop and Assent of the People</h3>
        <h2>Homily</h2>
        <p>
          There will then be an instructional homily discussing the practice of
          the priest hood according to the teachings of the Second Vatican
          Council. This homily will speak on how Christ as the teacher, priest,
          and shepherd continues through the ministerial priesthood. It also
          states that priests are to be colleagues of the bishop, joining with
          him in the task of exercising the priesthood office in service to the
          Citizens of God. The office reminds those too soon to be ordained that
          they are to model their lives on Jesus Christ, "The Good Shepherd, who
          came not to be served but to serve, and to seek out wand save what was
          lost".
        </p>
        <h3>Promises of the Elect</h3>
        <p>
          5 promises must be made to continue with the ordination ceremony
          <br />          <br />

          Promise to discharge the office of priesthood in the presbyterial rank
          as worthy fellow workers with the order of bishops
          <br />          <br />

          Promise to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely,
          preaching the gospel and teaching the Catholic faith
          <br />          <br />

          Promise to celebrate faithfully and reverently the mysteries of Christ
          handed down by the Church, especially the sacrifice of the Eucharist
          and the sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God and the
          Sanctification of the Christian People
          <br />          <br />

          Promise to implore God's mercy upon the people entrusted to their care
          by observing the Command to pray without ceasing.?
          <br />          <br />

          Promise to be united more closely every day to Christ the High Priest
          who offered himself for us to the Father as a pure sacrifice and to
          consecrate themselves to God for the Salvation of All
        </p>
        <h3>Promise of Obedience</h3>
        <p>
          Once all of these promises have been made, each candidate to be
          ordained goes to the bishop and makes a promise of obedience. When he
          does so he kneels before the bishop, placing his hands between the
          bishops. The bishop will then ask him "do you promise respect and
          obedience to me and my successors?" The candidate will then answer
          yes, otherwise he shall be refuted from the clergy.

        <div className="wrapperCenter"><br/><sup> Here we see the prostration that occurs during the Litany of Supplication.  Image Source 1</sup></div>

        <p>
          Every candidate that's made it this far will then prostrate onto the
          floor and the Litany of the Saints shall be sung. The Litany of the
          Saints I a prayer asking for the intercession of the saints in so that
          God may look down favorably upon those who are to be ordained. Then a
          prayer following the song occurs asking that the Holy Spirit may be
          poured upon them. During these prayers the faithful (laity) are to
          join in on the prayers for the candidates for ordination.
        </p>
        <h3>Invitation to Prayer</h3>
        <p>The congregation and minister pray for the soon to be ordained priests and that they receive good health and tidings.</p>
        <h3>Litany</h3>
        <p>The Litany of the Saints is sung in the church.  It's a very ancient prayer that is sung only on Easter Vigil and at Ordination ceremonies.  <sup>Source Z</sup></p>
        <h3>Concluding Prayer</h3>
        <h2>Laying on of Hands and Prayer of Ordination</h2>
        <p>
          The gift of the Holy Spirit is brought to those to be ordained by the
          laying on of hands and the final prayer of ordination. Here, at the
          ordination of a priest, the ordaining bishop shall lay his hands on
          each man to be ordained a priest. All of the priests who are present
          will then lay hands on each candidate just as the bishop did. This
          laying on of hands acts as a symbol that they are to be ordained into
          the presbyterial college of the Church they are being ordained at. All
          of this must be done in silence, that is because the clergy wishes to
          keep with an ancient tradition found within an old text known as
          Apostolic Tradition. Apostolic Tradition is believed by many to have
          been written by Hippolytus in 280 A.D. Here he states that the laying
          on of hands occurs in the priests ordination due to the fact that
          "they all have a common and similar spirit".
        </p>
        <div className="wrapperCenter"><h2>Laying on of Hands</h2></div>
        <div className="wrapperCenter"><img src={layingofhands} alt="Layingofhands" className="img2"/></div>
        <div className="wrapperCenter"><br/><sup> The laying on of hands occurs here as the bishop touches each one of the candidates for priesthood.  Image Source 2</sup></div>
        <p>
          Each candidate shall go one by one to the bishop and kneel before him.
          Then the bishop shall ay his hands on the head of each in complete
          silence. This laying on of hands and the prayer of ordination which
          follows directly after shall constitute the essential elements of the
          sacramant of Holy Orders. Then all the priests shal lay their hands on
          each head of the candidates.
        </p>
        <h3>Prayer of Ordination</h3>
        <p>
          The bishop will then say the prayer of ordination alone. This directly
          alludes to Aaron and the seventy elders as called by Moses. Old
          testament figures that prefigure the prebyters who will work as
          coworkers of the bishop? .This prayer is directed directly to the
          Father who by the grace of the Holy Spirit provides for all forms of
          ministry within the Church of Christ. After the bishop speaks upon the
          various forms of ministry exercised within the church he will state
          that the priests are those who assisted the apostles in making Christ
          present in the Church today.
        </p>
        <h2>Explanatory Rites</h2>
        <p> The Rites that follow are explanatory Rites:</p>
        <h3>Investiture with Stole and Chasuble</h3>
        <p>
          The newly ordained preists stay standing, and are vested with the
          stole and chasuble as symbolic representation of their new power and
          office in the church.
        </p>
        <h3>Anointing of Hands</h3>
        <p>
          The newly ordained priests have their hands anointed with "sacred
          chrism". This symbolizes the power granted before them to perform the
          Eucharist, changing bread into the Body of Christ and wine into the
          Blood of Christ.
        </p>
        <h3>Presentation of Bread and Wine</h3>
        <p>
          The ordaining bishop shall then receive gifts of bread and wine from
          the laity celebrating mass. Once the chalice and paten have been
          prepared, it si presented to the bishop, who then presents it to the
          new preists as they kneel before him.{' '}
        </p>
        <h3>Kiss of Peace</h3>
        <p>
          The bishop leading the ordination ceremony gives a fraternal kiss that
          is also known as the sign of peace to each of the new priests. The
          attending priests also follow suite. This gesture specificallyt is a
          sign of welcome into the Priesthood of the Catholic Church, which they
          all share duty in as brothers.
        </p>
        <div className="wrapperCenter"><h3>Liturgy of Eucharist</h3></div>

        <div className="wrapperCenter"><br/><sup>Eucharist being given to the Laity.  Image Source 3</sup></div>

        <p>And so the newly ordained priests may engage in the Eucharist with the laity as a ordained priest for the first time.  It's a time of celebration and great reverence, as the priests give their first Eucharist with their audience of Ordination.  </p>
