        <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
        <p>The Dark web represents (within the western world) the fear of a power structure that exists beyond the realm of authority.</p>
        
        <p>There is a common visualization of what the dark net is, it’s the “alleyway of the internet”.  It’s this black market, a hidden marketplace for murder, sex, human trafficking, drugs, and much much more.  Not only is it a place hidden from law enforcement it is a place that is morally defunct. “Read nearly any article about the dark web, and you'll get the sense that its name connotes not just its secrecy but also the low-down dirty content of its shadowy realms. You’ll be told that it is home to several nefarious things: stolen data, terrorist sites, and child porn” - Joseph Cox, journalist for Wired news.  Whether or not this is true these rumors come from somewhere and they mean something.  On various news outlets and websites there has been discussion that Al Qaeda had been using the dark web in order to communicate world wide, creating terrorist forums for extremists. </p>

           <p>
           The internet has been around since the mid 1980s as a network of networks.  Why have people been deciding that the Dark Web is a lawless black market for anything and everything?  The “dark” name?  The stories of the Silk Road?  
           Regardless, we can see it’s reputation as being filled with lawless market dealings.  The boogeyman of the internet.  Something out there that is morally defunct from the rest of society.  It must be run by shady criminals right?  
           </p>

           <p>
           We consider it as being run by something akin to a mafia, an organized crime indication.  There is this fear of what is being sold, the illicit.  The crime.  It’s the idea that something is being run from underneath our incorruptible internet connection, something we can tap into with the breeze of our fingers.  A dangerous element.  We can look at it as a sort of inversion of society almost.  It’s been compared to the wild west after all, why not discuss it and view it as such?  Little to no moderation, many shady dealings, and danger around every click of a hyperlink.  Why wouldn’t we fear it?  
           </p>
          
           <p>I would view it almost as a conspiracy (once again ignore the binary truth value we assign to things).  The idea that there exists this massive shadow network 
             of individuals in a seedy market that is accessible from our own internet connection is a daunting one to say the least.  To think that there are recorded instance
             s of people running massive drug trades worldwide via this marketplace.  But, the thing that the dark net/deep web assigns to itself more than anything is anonymity. 
              Put on the (IP address) mask and walk into a new world.  A world where you can’t see anyone's real name or face, race, or ethnicity. 
              A place where you can only see what is being sold.  You could buy a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher, you could order a hitman, child pornography, perhaps receive 
              a mail order bride.  Anyone could do it in fact.  It’s as simple as having an internet connection and a bank account.  Mind you, you can also just turn your money into
               cryptocurrency, an also untraceable method of conducting business across any platform.  
              </p>
          
          <p>Is it the fear of anonymity in the otherwise constantly identifiable world?  Whereas you may be anonymous at your own whim on many sites, now everyone has it?  The fear of unidentifiable power that anyone could have.  Your neighbor, your best friend, your mother, brother, any of them really.  The president could have it, the business owner down the street could order whatever they wanted.  The ease of access (and simultaneously the lack of knowledge on the ease of access) is a level of terrifying knowledge that many people think just having is incriminating enough.  There exists a concept about the Darkweb in part a combination of powerful anonymity and ease of access that people mystify it as such.  However one must consider the idea that there is a large population of the American public that doesn’t actually KNOW* how to access it.  They don’t know you can download the TOR (The Onion Router) to access any website with a level of privacy that the common individual just assumes they may already have.  Using TOR you can access anything by using various encryptions in order to protect your privacy, thus allowing any basic browsing data on an individual to be hidden from various purchasers/gatherers of information. 
          </p>

          <p>Despite the fact that this anonymity has been used for much good such as whistleblowing on corruption within government agencies and corporations, there
            is this belief that such anonymity means there are darker secrets to hide.
