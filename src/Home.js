        <p>My name is William Alan Patterson II and I am a University of North Carolina 
          Chapel Hill student double majoring in Religion and Computer Science.</p>
        
        <p>This is a website designed for the 2020 May-Mester Supernatural Encounters class taught 
          by Professor Brendan Thornton. 
          This version is published as of 5/29 at approxximately 10 am.  
          I will continue to update this gradually to look better, and even to update the content as time goes on. 
           I've enjoyed the class greatly and despite the crunchtime of
          this incredibly condensed semester It's been a blast.
        </p>
        <p>Have a great summer Prof Thornton!  I'll see you in the fall electronically or physically!</p>
