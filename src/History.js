            Discernment is the process in which a Catholic individual begins to
            recognize their vocation within the church. They can discern into
            three different vocations, life as a layman in the church, ordained
            life, and consecrated life.
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className='t1'> Laity</div>
            Not ordained, nor held to any vows. Laity are the people who
            frequent the church and are not ordained into the clergy or involved
            with the Institute of Consecrated Life. This is 99% of the church.
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className='t1'>Ordained</div>
            These are individuals who have received the scarament of Ordination,
            also known as the Holy Orders. The ordained are not only priests and
            bishops, but 1/3 of all ordained are members of the Institute of
            Consecrated life <sup>Source 1</sup>.
            <br />
            <br />

            <div className='t1'>The Institute of Consecrated Life</div>
          
            This is a group within the church who have chosen to devote their
            lives to what they consider to be service to god and human kind,
            through activity within the framework of "institutes of Consecrated
            Life"
            <br/>
            These individuals choose to give up certain aspects of their
            life. They believe that it is beneficial to give up things that form
            significant pieces of most other people's lives. These members are
            committed to the three "Evangelical Counsels". They aim to live in a
            level of poverty not amassing significant personal wealth, obedience
            to one's legitimate superiors, and chastity. More than anything
            these individuals seek to be a part of a group that have a clear and
            defined orientation, purpose, and ideology within the Church. Many
            individuals within the Institute of Consecrated life devote their
            lives to a specific cause that they see as aiding one or another
            groups or communities.

            Monks and Nuns are the most well-known of
            the "religious" practitioners of the Institutes of Consecrated Life.
            There are many reasons for someone to be interested in monastic life
            however it's impossible to ignore that these are lives of antiquity.
            The exact vows that monks and nuns take differ greatly upon the
            various monastic orders and monasteries. All require that they take
            vows to the Evangelical Counsels, but they can also take vows
            adhering to fidelity of the monastic way of life which may include
            chastity, poverty, commitment to remain in the same monastery for
            the rest of their life, and obedience to the abbot or group rules.

            <br />
            <br />
            The first thing you need to know is what Discernment means:
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className='t1'>Discernment:</div>
            1. the ability to judge well.
            <br />
            2. (in Christian contexts) perception in the absence of judgment
            with a view to obtaining spiritual guidance and understanding.
            (Oxford Languages definition)
            <br />
            <br />
            The first step to becoming ordained is discernment. It's the
            pondering and making of the decision to enter the priesthood. Under
            the Arch Diocese of Boston a "Discernment guide" <sup>
              Source 5
            </sup>{' '}
            has been created. This has the goal of helping people understand
            whether or not they wish to go into the priesthood.
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 1: understanding happiness Give up my idea of what will make me
            happy Seek to do the fathers will
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 2: Created for a Purpose You have a purpose, you are totally
            unique. Jesus loves you so much that he invites you to help him save
            the world….. The first step in discerning your vocation is to
            understand that God has created you out of love and in his love
            invites you to share in his work of saving the world
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 3: His will is best
            <br />
            By accepting this step you are submitting your life to the grace of
            God.
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 4:Listen
            <br />
            Learn to listen to the voice of God, block out some of the noice
            from our already incredibly immersive life and take a step back. In
            this way we see a similar discussion to that of rejecting the
            physical world as is done by Buddhist monks, but in a different
            sense. Catholicism doesn't outright condemn these things, however in
            order to pursure the priesthood one must learn to block out some of
            the worlds more earthly distractions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 5: Rid Life of Obstacles
            <br />
            This means overcoming the past, fear, and the worldy guilt that comes from sin.
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 6: Give Everything
            <br />
            This next step is about responding to that love Jesus gives us and
            all taht we are. Give yourself entirely to Jesus, and build up your
            personal relationship with him. In this step the use of the
            Sacramants, Prayer, and Virtues are discussed to help find depth in
            a relationship with Jesus. They end touching upon Aesceticism, or as
            the church defines it "Making Sacrifices" in order to fully embrace
            Jesus's love.
            <br />
            <br />
            Step 7:Know His voice
            <br />
            This one is interesting. According to the Arch-Diocese of Boston we
            see a discussion of 4 different voices The voice of God, The self,
            The Devil, and The World. Properly understanding these voices taht
            occur around and within us is important to becoming a priest,
            developing a secure sense of self, and a secure relationship with
            Jesus.

            <div className="t1">Monastic groups:</div> Joining one of the groups of the
            institute of Consecrated life can take many years. After several
            months of living alongside with the community (but not with) their
            candidacy is considered. Many people decide to leave from there,
            choosing to find a calling elsewhere. If they are indeed accepted
            then a trial period will commence before they can continue further.
            This usually lasts from one to two years. During this they can take
            temporary vows, further committing themselves into their respected
            institute. At the end of three years if they wish to bind themselves
            to the group then they can take permanent vows.

            <br />

            In order to qualify for ordination you need a sponsorship. In order
            to get one you must approach any one of the Archdiocese and simply
            request it. This requires quite a few documents such as:
            <br /> <br />
            - A personal autobiography that outlines your life using the general
            categories of Family, Relationships, Education/Employment, Outlook
            on life/Faith and Practice of Religion/ Discernment, Priesthood.
            <br /> <br />
            -Letters of Reference from people who know you well such as your
            pastor, priests, employers, educators, and even friends
            <br /> <br />
            - Archdiocesan Sponsorship Application and Seminary Application
            Forms
            <br /> <br />
            - Legal Release Documents allowing the those responsible in the
            Church to evaluate your application
            <br /> <br />
            - A medical evaluation to assure you are in good health
            <br /> <br />
            - A psychological evaluation that screens for major mental illness
            and provides a general personality profile
            <br /> <br />
            - Background Screening Evaluation through law enforcement
            organizations - Documentation of sacramental history such as baptism
            and confirmation
            <br /> <br />
            - Documents of educational history such as school transcripts, and
            standardized tests
            <br /> <br />
            - Some essays on your understanding of the nature and role of the
            priest and the role of obedience and celibacy in the life of the
            priest
            <br /> <br />
            - Documents that show your identity, such as State issued ID, drivers license, birth certificate, etc....
            <br /> <br />
            
            <br /> <br />
            <br /> Once you've turned all of this in on top of any other
            paperwork that might be required (Some diocese request various
            separate forms be filled out) then the Diocese must go through all
            of it and set up different interviews. Interview at a seminary After
            completing the Application for Sponsorship, the Archdiocese will
            make a decision regarding your application, and when a positive
            decision is made, you will be presented to a seminary for interview
            and acceptance into their seminary formation program.
            <br />
            <br />
            The interview at the seminary usually involves meeting with several
            members of the seminary faculty, either in a group or individual
            interview to discuss your desire to discern and be formed in the
            seminary. While it is not simply a “rubber stamp”, it is not common
            for a man to be recommended by the Archdiocese and then not be
            admitted to a particular seminary.
            <br />
            <br />
            Next are formation programs, there are three formation programs
            available to men who desire to discern and prepare for the diocesan
            priesthood<sup>Source 4</sup>. These programs are outlined in
            relation to stages of intellectual formation as is understood by the
            Catholic Church, with the understanding that at each stage of
            formation, all four pillars of formation (Human, Spiritual,
            Intellectual, Pastoral) are built upon for the seminarian.

            <br/>
            College Seminary: In this program a seminarian attends classes at a
            college seminary (ex. - Providence College in Providence, Rhode
            Island... etc) while aiming toward a Bachelor's Degree in the Arts
            and a Major of Philosophy. While attending classes as a member of
            the general student and enjoying all the resources available to
            students there, he may live and take his meals, etc, with other
            Seminarians. This program from start to finish is 4 years in length.
            New men are able to apply to this program at any stage (as a
            Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or Senior), according to their personal
            discernment, and must be in consultation and have a recommendation
            of the Vocation Office.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pre-Theology: This program is one that prepares a priest to enter
            into the Theology Seminary program. The Pre-Theology program is for
            men who begin seminary formation having already earned a Four
            year/Bachelors Degree (in any field), but who haven't been able to
            receive any, or enough, Philosophical training. The study of
            philosophy is foundational to the study of theology, so the members
            of this program generally aim toward a Bachelors in Philosophy,
            studying especially, Ancient philosophy of Metaphysics, this will
            prepare students to study the Theological giants of the Church. This
            program is typically 2 years in length.
            <br />
            <br />
            Theology: In this program, the seminarians education builds toward a
            Masters of Divinity (M.Div.) or Masters of Arts (MA), while becoming
            an expert in the theological tradition of the Catholic Church.
            Courses include those typically found in any M.Div. or MA program
            but with numerous other courses that are particularly useful to
            those seeking Ordination. This program is 4 years in length.
            <br />
            <br />
              Once all of this is done then you may be considered for ordination under the Catholic Church
